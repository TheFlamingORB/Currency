Currency is a new way of handling an economy in your Bukkit server. Unlike most other economy plugins, Currency is broken into two separate plugins, one containing the database and account handling (CurrencyCore) and the other containing the commands (CurrencyBasic). Even more different, CurrencyBasic is written in JRuby using RubyBukkit making it easy to edit in real time to suit your needs.

Why another economy plugin? An economy management plugin does not need to do more than hold data. It should be utilized through it's API in other plugins to interact with the server's players. This is exactly what this plugin does, as CurrencyBasic is entirely optional and can be easily replaced/edited.
